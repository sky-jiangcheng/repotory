#!/usr/bin/env bash
# scripts/verify-restore.sh — one command that answers the only question a
# backup exists for: "if the live database dies, will this snapshot bring it
# back?"
#
# Why this exists. ADR-0025 requires a REAL restore drill on a real machine
# before the backup feature can be called done, and until now that drill was
# performed by hand: copy a snapshot, spin up a headless server against it,
# poke at it, tear it down. Every rehearsal cost a person an afternoon and
# left nothing behind that could be repeated. A backup nobody has ever
# restored is a hypothesis, not a backup — and the hypothesis that breaks
# first is the boring one: the server starts, but the FTS index is empty, or
# the page count is zero, or the data dir resolution quietly points at the
# LIVE database instead of the copy.
#
# So the drill becomes a script:
#
#   1. pick a snapshot (the one given, or the newest in the backup dir);
#   2. record its sha256;
#   3. COPY it into an isolated home directory;
#   4. check the copy's integrity (sqlite quick_check, read-only);
#   5. start a headless server against that copy, with HOME pointing at the
#      isolated directory;
#   6. ask it for /health, the note count, the approved-page count, and run
#      one full-text search for a term taken FROM the snapshot itself;
#   7. stop the server, drop the isolated home, and re-read the snapshot's
#      sha256 to prove that nothing wrote to it.
#
# The server is built from THIS checkout when Go is available, so the drill
# exercises the code under test and not whatever release happens to be
# installed. A stale installed binary can fail a drill for reasons that have
# nothing to do with the snapshot — that is how a good snapshot gets
# condemned. Pass --server to pin a specific binary instead.
#
# The discipline (ADR-0025 promotion condition 1): the live database is never
# opened. The server runs with an isolated HOME, so the data dir it resolves
# is inside the temp directory — even a bug in the server cannot reach the
# real data dir. The snapshot is copied, never moved; the copy is opened
# read-only, the snapshot file itself is only ever hashed.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/verify-restore.sh                       # newest snapshot
#   scripts/verify-restore.sh /path/to/snapshot.db  # a specific one
#   scripts/verify-restore.sh --query "登录"         # a specific search term
#
# Exit codes: 0 = the snapshot can bring the knowledge base back,
#             1 = it cannot (or the drill could not be run at all).
