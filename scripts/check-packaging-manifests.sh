# Guard the package-manager manifests BEFORE they are pushed to the tap and
# the bucket.
#
# Why this file exists. The tap's own CI caught a real defect on 2026-10-26:
# the in-repo cask carried a `license "MIT"` stanza, and `license` is a
# FORMULA method — `brew install --cask` rejects the whole definition with
# "undefined method 'license' for Cask". The in-repo manifests had never been
# install-tested, because the tap's CI only ever exercised the hand-maintained
# `reponest` cask; the manifests under packaging/ were updated in this
# repository and then went nowhere (the copy that packaging/README.md
# described did not exist until scripts/sync-packaging.sh was added).
#
# So the defect reached the tap and made the tap red, instead of failing
# here. That is the wrong order: this repository is where the manifests are
# authored, so it is where they should be checked.
#
# Two checks, both runnable on Linux (no Homebrew needed):
#
#   1. Every Scoop manifest is valid JSON with the fields Scoop requires.
#      A JSON manifest with a `#` comment line is unparseable, and the bucket
#      rejects it — that happened too, with the alias manifests.
#
#   2. Every Homebrew Cask uses only Cask DSL. The Formula-only methods this
#      guard knows about are listed in FORMULA_ONLY_METHODS; the list is not
#      exhaustive, it is the set that has actually bitten.
