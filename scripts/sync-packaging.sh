#
# --with-workflows also replaces the tap's / bucket's own CI definitions with
# the copies kept under packaging/. It is OFF by default because GitHub
# refuses to let a token without the `workflow` scope create or update
# .github/workflows/* files: the push fails with "refusing to allow an OAuth
# App to create or update workflow ... without `workflow` scope", and a
# half-applied sync is worse than a manifest-only one. Run it with a token
# that carries the scope, or update those files by hand.
#
# Why this script exists. packaging/README.md says the tap and the bucket
# "are copied here on every release" — that was never true, and nothing
# enforced it. The result was a tap and a bucket still serving the PRE-RENAME
# RepoNest v1.8.0 manifests while the product shipped v2.14.0: `brew install
# --cask repotory` did not exist, and `brew install --cask reponest` silently
# installed a six-versions-old build. The manifests were updated in THIS
# repository (release.yml's fill-sha256 job commits them back to master) and
# then went nowhere.
#
# So this script is the missing half: it copies packaging/ into the tap and the
# bucket and, with --push, commits and pushes. release.yml's sync job runs it
# after each release, so the two cannot drift again.
#
# The pre-rename names (reponest / reponest-mcp) are kept as ALIASES: the same
# current artifact under the old token, so a command somebody saved before the
# rename keeps working — and now installs the CURRENT build instead of the
# v1.8.0 fossil it used to fetch. An alias that points at the old release is
# worse than no alias: it fails silently, and "I installed it and it is six
# versions behind" is a far more expensive report than "no such cask".

# The manifests carry a sha256 per asset, and brew/scoop HARD-FAIL when the
# download does not match. So a manifest that still holds an older release's
# digest is not "slightly wrong" — it is an install path that fails on the
# user's machine.
#
# That is not hypothetical. The digests are filled by the release workflow's
# fill-sha256 job, which commits the filled manifests back to master. A
# manual sync run from a checkout that predates that commit publishes the
# PREVIOUS release's digests, and the tap/bucket then point at artifacts that
# no longer match what the release serves. (Seen for real on v2.18.0: the
# first manual sync shipped v2.17.0's digests, and Homebrew would have
# rejected the download.)
#
# So: before pushing, ask the Release API which digests this version
# actually serves, and refuse to publish anything that is not in that set.
