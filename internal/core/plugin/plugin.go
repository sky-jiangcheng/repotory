// and the idempotent upsert path live in internal/core/plugin/runtime;

// ProbeResult is the outcome of a knowledge source's presence check: whether
// the agent's data actually exists on this machine, plus a short
// human-readable detail line (root path, match count) for the settings page.
// A probe is cheap and read-only — stat/readdir on the source's own
// allowlisted directory, never file content, never parent/sibling paths
// (ADR-0011 决策 3 hard scoping, ADR-0022 决策 1).

// Prober is an OPTIONAL capability of a KnowledgeImporter. Sources that

// Rejection is one document an importer refused to produce, and why.
//
// It exists because "the importer silently dropped files" is invisible by
// construction: an importer that cannot parse one file returns fewer
// documents, and the runtime reports "created 0, updated 0, skipped 0" —
// indistinguishable from "there was nothing new to import". That is not a
// hypothetical. On 2026-10-18 the opencode importer's Summary field changed
// type upstream; every session file then failed to unmarshal, every session
// was silently rejected, and the import reported zero created notes with no
// error anywhere. The symptom was noticed days later, by a user wondering
// why nothing had come in.
type Rejection struct {
	// Path is the file that was rejected, when the importer knows it.
	Path string
	// Reason is a short human-readable explanation.

// RejectionReporter is an OPTIONAL capability of a KnowledgeImporter.
//
// An importer that can tell the difference between "nothing to import" and
// "I could not read this" implements it, and the runtime folds the result
// into the import report (ImportRun.Failed / ImportRun.Errors) and the
// settings page shows it.
//
// It is optional rather than required because the alternative — adding a
// rejections return value to Import() — would change every importer's
// signature at once, for a capability most sources have no use for. An
// importer that does not implement it keeps its current behaviour, which is
// correct for a source whose "nothing found" really does mean "nothing found".
type RejectionReporter interface {
	Rejections() []Rejection

// ImportDoc is a single document produced by a KnowledgeImporter, to be
// upserted into the knowledge base.
type ImportDoc struct {
	// ProjectID is the resolved target project. 0 means "the importer could not
	// match a project"; the runtime then LANDS the note rather than dropping it
	// (ADR-0023): onto a placeholder project keyed by RepoPath when one is known,
	// else onto the seeded default ("Uncategorized") project. A truly non-empty
	// RepoPath is what lets an unmatched repo-scoped source still get a home.
	ProjectID int64
	// RepoPath is the source's repository/workspace path (a real filesystem path
	// when the importer has one). Used only when ProjectID == 0 to create or reuse
	// an import-placeholder project; because it is stored as the placeholder's
	// root_path, a later scan that discovers the same repo adopts the row and
	// promotes it to a real project. Empty for agent-global sources (openclaw,
	// hermes, codebuddy-memory), which then land on the default project.
	RepoPath string
	// RepoName optionally overrides the placeholder project's display name; when
	// empty the runtime uses the base name of RepoPath. Sources whose match key is
	// a decoded label rather than a real path (claude) set this.
	RepoName string
	Title    string // note title
	Content  string // note body (Markdown)
	Tags     string // comma-separated tags
	Kind     string // note kind: knowledge | log | idea | other
	Source   string // provenance, e.g. "claude"
