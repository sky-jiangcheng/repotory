// Frontend↔binding contract guard.
//
// Why this file exists. The browser frontend reaches every binding through one
// transport call, and the method name is a plain string:
//
//	call<SearchHit[]>({ method: 'SearchAll', args: [query] })
//
// TypeScript cannot check that string against the Go binding surface, so
// renaming or removing an *App method breaks the browser/standalone runtime at
// CALL time, not at build time — and the desktop Wails runtime shares the same
// method names, so both halves fail the same way: a runtime error in the
// console, found by whoever happens to click that button.
//
// api_contract_test.go already guards the other direction (the API reference
// must not promise a binding that does not exist). This file guards the one
// that actually breaks users: the bindings the frontend calls must exist.
//
// The frontend's transport is the single source of truth for the browser
// runtime, so its call list is the thing worth pinning — not a hand-kept
// duplicate of it.

const frontendEndpointsPath = "../../web/src/api/endpoints.ts"

// frontendMethodCall matches a transport method name. The frontend writes
// every one as a single-quoted literal (`method: 'SearchAll'`), so the pattern
// requires the quote — that is what keeps it from matching a helper
// parameter named `method` (jsonInit in endpoints.ts).
var frontendMethodCall = regexp.MustCompile(`method:\s*'([A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*)'`)

// frontendInitBlock matches the RequestInit the transport carries alongside
// the RPC method: `init: { method: 'POST' }`. Its own `method` key is an HTTP
// VERB, not a binding name — extracting it would ask the Go side for a
// binding called "POST". The blocks carry no nested braces today; the
// extractor fails loudly (the count sanity check) if that ever changes.
var frontendInitBlock = regexp.MustCompile(`init:\s*\{[^}]*\}`)

// frontendTransportMethods returns the distinct binding names the browser
// frontend calls over the transport.

// and the user gets a runtime failure in the browser runtime and in the
// desktop app alike.
