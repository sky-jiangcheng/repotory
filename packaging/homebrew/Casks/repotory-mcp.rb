# Repotory MCP server (macOS)
#
# The MCP stdio server is the AI execution interface for Repotory — the desktop
# app is not required to use it, it reads the same local SQLite database.
#
# Version is stamped by scripts/update-manifests.sh from wails.json
# (info.productVersion) — never edit it by hand.
