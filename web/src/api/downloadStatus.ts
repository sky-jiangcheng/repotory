// api/downloadStatus.ts — the app-wide state of "is an update downloading?".
//
// Why a store instead of component state. The download is shown in two
// places at once: a modal progress dialog, and (once the user minimizes it)
// a small card in the corner. Both must show the SAME numbers — a modal
// reading 62% while the corner card reads 41% is worse than either alone.
// The same shape as the update verdict store (api/updateStatus.ts): one
// snapshot, subscribers.
//
// The progress is POLLED, not pushed. The backend downloads in the
// background and exposes the state through a binding; the frontend polls it
// on an interval while a download is in flight. Polling (rather than a
// Wails event) is deliberate: the download is also reachable from the
// headless server's browser UI over the RPC bridge, where a Wails runtime
// event has no listener. Polling works identically in both runtimes.
//
// The store never downloads anything by itself — it exposes start/cancel and
// the state, and the components decide what to show.
