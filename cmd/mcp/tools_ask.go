// registerAskTool wires repotory_ask: the question-answering tool.
//
// What it used to be, and why that was not an answer. The tool ran
// svc.SearchAll(query) and formatted the first five hits as text — an FTS
// grep with a friendly wrapper. An agent asking "why do we retry on 503?" got
// five note titles and had to do the answering itself, while the desktop
// panel (AskAIWithEvidence) produced an actual answer with citations. Two
// surfaces answering the same question differently is the drift this repo
// keeps writing ADRs about.
//
// What it is now: the SAME retrieval and the SAME prompt assembly as the
// desktop panel — svc.AskAIWithEvidence — so the answer and its sources are
// one implementation, not two. TODO Sprint 1.5's acceptance bar ("the desktop
// and MCP give an answer with sources for the same question") is a statement
// about code identity, not about a similar look.
//
// The fallback matters and is not a euphemism. An install with no AI endpoint
// configured gets keyword matches back — but it is TOLD they are keyword
// matches and not an answer. Silently returning grep output as if it were an
// answer would be the worst of both worlds: the agent would treat five note
// titles as a conclusion. And a configured-but-failing endpoint is an ERROR,
// not a fallback: "the endpoint is down" and "you have no endpoint" are
// different facts, and only the first one is worth retrying.
